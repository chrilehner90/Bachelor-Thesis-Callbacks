#Example of Callbacks for my Bachelor Thesis

This application is an asynchronous file uploader, which was developed for my bachelor thesis at University of Applied Science Salzburg. It uses the FileReader API, FormData, XMLHTTPRequest. This app works uses normal callbacks.
The Backend uses the Q Promises Library: https://github.com/kriskowal/q

Clone the app and execute it with the following command:
```
node app.js
```
